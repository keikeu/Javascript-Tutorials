Hot to find Whitespace:

Use regular expression selectors 

\s to find whitespace in a string.
" " (space)
\r (the carriage return)
\n (newline)
\t (tab)
\f (the form feed).

The whitespace regular expression looks like this:
/\s+/g

Help:
\s+ means at least 1, possibly more, spaces.
g means that the regex should match the string globally, so that str.replace will replace all occurrences of the pattern


EXAMPLES:
Instructions
Use \s to select all the whitespace characters in the sentence string.

// Setup
var testString = "Count how many spaces are there in this sentence";



WARNING ANSWER AHEAD:

_____________________________________________________

var expression = /\s+/g; 
// This code counts the matches of expression in testString
var spaceCount = testString.match(expression).length;
